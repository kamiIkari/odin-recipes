    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta of your choice</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>parmesan</li>
            <li>parsley</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a medium-sized saucepot, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the 
                package instructions. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water 
                and drain the pasta.</p></li>

            <li><p>To make the garlic butter sauce for pasta: In a skillet, melt butter on medium heat and saute 
                the sliced garlic very lightly. Add the hot pasta along with a part of the pasta water, and toss it 
                using kitchen tongs until a sort of thick sauce is coating the pasta. Keep on tossing and add more pasta 
                water if needed.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Remove from heat, and add freshly grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley leaves. Toss 
                continuously and season with salt if needed. Serve warm with extra grated parmesan cheese 
                and enjoy!</p></li>
        </ol>
